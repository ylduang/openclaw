# Agents API harness

The `agentsapi` harness uses API-key authentication and an OpenAI-hosted Linux
environment. Select it through `agents.defaults.agentRuntime.id` or an agent's
`agentRuntime.id`. See the [harness configuration reference](https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/sdk-agent-harness/runtime-config).

The Gateway must be the only writer to each hosted session bound to OpenClaw.
Send messages, steering, and interrupts through OpenClaw. Do not also write to
that hosted session from another API client or a Gateway with independent state.
Keep write credentials under the trusted Gateway operator's control. This
exclusivity is a deployment requirement, not API-enforced session isolation.
Binding leases coordinate OpenClaw attempts; tool execution retains current
ownership and cancellation checks. External concurrent writers are unsupported.

Saved sessions keep their hosted conversation, workspace, and original tool
declarations when Gateway tools are added. Fresh sessions receive the current
Gateway tool declarations. Reset an existing session to adopt the new tool
surface; changing its model or API key still requires a reset.

Child sessions use the same Gateway tool-policy filtering as other OpenClaw
runtimes, including inherited restrictions and the child's role. Denied session
and control tools stay unavailable. Policies that restrict hosted shell, file,
or native web-search access are rejected before the hosted session starts or
resumes; the MVP cannot narrow those native capabilities.

Token accounting reads canonical native turn records after settlement, since
completion stream events can omit usage. Each OpenClaw attempt counts its new
coordinator turns once, including work superseded by steering. Earlier turns in
the same native session are excluded. Cached input is counted separately from
uncached input; reasoning tokens remain included in output tokens.

Successful assistant messages retain those totals in the OpenClaw transcript.
When a Gateway tool ends the native turn, a transcript entry with no assistant
content retains usage without publishing another reply.
Run results and completion hooks also retain usage reported for interrupted or
failed work after native cleanup settles. Historical session usage is derived
from transcript messages, so other interrupted work without an assistant message
is not included in that historical report. A bounded five-second settlement window
waits for late turn records and usage. Counts are not refreshed after that
snapshot. Accounting read failures retain the last available snapshot and log a
warning; they do not discard a completed reply or replace cancellation. Missing
native usage remains unavailable; native counts can change as
upstream accounting arrives. See the
[official usage guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/agents-api/observability).

Native turn billing can sum multiple model calls. It does not establish the
current context-window usage. Cost estimates use the configured model prices;
they are not provider billing receipts.
