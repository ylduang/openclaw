/**
 * Dispatches a real task to a pool worker and lets the host deadline abort it:
 * the input factory resolves immediately (so the task is posted to the worker
 * over IPC), then the worker blocks on Atomics.wait, so the pool's own deadline
 * timer (worker-task-pool-core.ts:525) aborts the dispatched task with the
 * production WorkerTaskError("worker task timed out", "timeout").
 *
 * The pool is warmed with a settled task first so worker boot has already
 * finished; otherwise the worker's first dispatch can lag the fake deadline on
 * a loaded host and the check would abort a queued, not dispatched, task.
 *
 * The caller must assert the returned view proves the worker started the task
 * (view[0] > 0) outside the fallback owner, which would otherwise swallow a
 * failing dispatch proof as an ordinary candidate error.
